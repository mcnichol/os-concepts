    "<div>An operating system is software that manages the computer hardware as well as providing an environment for application programs to run.</div>",
    "<div>Interrupts are a key way in which hardware interacts with the operating system. A hardware device triggers an interrupt by sending a signal to the CPU to alert the CPU that some event requires attention. The interrupt is managed by the interrupt handler.</div>",
    "<div>For a computer to do its job of executing programs, the programs must be in main memory, which is the only large storage area that the processor can access directly.</div>",
    "<div>The main memory is usually a volatile storage device that loses its contents when power is turned off or lost.</div>",
    "<div>Nonvolatile storage is an extension of main memory and is capable of holding large quantities of data permanently.</div>",
    "<div>The most common nonvolatile storage device is a hard disk, which can provide storage of both programs and data.</div>",
    "<div>The wide variety of storage systems in a computer system can be organized in a hierarchy according to speed and cost. The higher levels are expensive, but they are fast. As we move down the hierarchy, the cost per bit generally decreases, whereas the access time generally increases.</div>",
    "<div>Modern computer architectures are multiprocessor systems in which each CPU contains several computing cores.</div>",
    "<div>To best utilize the CPU, modern operating systems employ multiprogramming, which allows several jobs to be in memory at the same time,thus ensuring the the CPU always has a job to execute.</div>",
    "<div>Multitasking is an extension of multiprogramming wherein CPU scheduling algorithms rapidly switch between processes, providing users with a fast response time.</div>",
    "<div>To prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system, the system hardware has two modes: user mode and kernel mode.</div>",
    "<div>Various instructions are privileged and can be executed only in kernel mode. Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel mode, I/O control, timer management, and interrupt management.</div>",
    "<div>A process is the fundamental unit of work in an operating system. Process management includes creating and deleting processes and providing mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize with each other.</div>",
    "<div>An operating system manages memory by keeping track of what parts of memory are being used and by whom. It is also responsible for dynamically allocating and freeing memory space.</div>",
    "<div>Storage space is managed by the operating system; this includes providing file systems for representing files and directories and managing space on mass-storage devices.</div>",
    "<div>Operating systems provide mechanisms for protecting and securing the operating system and users. Protection measures control the access of processes or users to the resources made available by the computer system.</div>",
    "<div>Virtualization involves abstracting a computer's hardware into several different execution environments.</div>",
    "<div>Data structures that are used in an operating system include lists, stacks, queues, trees, and maps.</div>",
    "<div>Computing takes place in a variety of environments, including traditional computing, mobile computing, client-server systems, peer-to-peer systems, cloud computing, and real-time embedded systems.</div>",
    "<div>Free and open-source operating systems are available in source-code format. Free software is licensed to allow no-cost use, redistribution, and modification. GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris are examples of popular open-source systems.</div>"],

    "answerIndividual": "<div>The three main purposes of an operating system are to manage the computers hardware, act as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware, and provide a bases for application programs to interface with the underlying system.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>The three main purposes are:<ul><li>To provide an environment for a computer user to eecute programs on computer hardware in a convenient and efficient manner.</li><li>To allocate the separate resources of the computer as needed to solve the problem given. The allocation process should be as fair and efficient as possible.</li><li>As a control program it serves two major functions: (1)supervision of the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer, and (2) management of the operation and control of I/O devices.</li></ul></div>"

    "question":"<div>We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to <i>Waste</i> resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?</div>", 
    "answerIndividual": "<div>On single-user systems the system should be as efficient as possible maximizing resource utilization. When operating as a multi-user system, context switching and the overhead and dynamic nature of workloads being executed introduces potential lossses of efficiency for individual tasks in order to distribute resources in an apparent simultaneous manner to end-users. Resource utilization tends to be general purpose in nature and less specialized for a specific workload.</div>",

    "question":"<div>What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real-time environment?</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>A primary issue faced by real-time operating systems is the timing and sequence of events. Having these events execute in order and in a timely fashion can be critical to the functionality (and safety) of the system.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>The main difficulty is keeping the operating system within the fixed time constraints of a real-time system.  If the system does not complete a task in a certain time-frame, it may cause a breakdown of the entire system it is running. Therefore when writing an operating system for a real-time system, the writer must be sure that his scheduling schemes don't allow response time to exceed the time constraint.</div>"

    "question":"<div>Keeping in mind the various definitions of <i>operating system</i>, consider whether the operating system should include applications such as web browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it should not, and support your answers.</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div><div><b>Argument for O/S's Containing Browsers/Mail Apps:<b>Operating Systems should contain apps such as Browsers and Mail programs when considering the expected usaage of the operating system.  For Corporations distributing Operating Systems to machines of their employees these applications become a core system in how work is accomplished. Having base applications can provide a foundation of functinoality and consistency which devs can rely on to exist for integrations, security, and expand how operating systems are used moving forward.</div><div><b>Argument against O/S's Containing Browsers/Mail Apps:</b>It would not make sense to install application browsers and mail clients alongside operating/systems as it is tangential to the primary purpose of the Operating System itself. A more appropriate path is to allow users to select these apps that may (or may not) be critical to how they perform work and in that, choose which one is a best fit. In breaking these apps out from the Operating System we remove added areas which could cause vulneerabilities, additional overhead to the release cadence, ultimately increasing complexity in the base system image. To further extend this point, it would be impossible to determine which of these apps are actually core to the system vs userr add-ons therefore a module based system that users can select from would be ideal.</div></div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>An argument in favor of including popular applications with the operating system is that if the application is embedded within the operating system, it is likely to be better able to take advantage of features in the kernel and therefore have performance advantages over an application that runs outside of the kernel. Arguments against however: (1) the applications are applications - and not part of an operating system, (2) any performance benefits of running within the kernel are offset by security vulnerabilities, (3) it leads to a bloated operating system.</div>"

    "question":"<div>How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "The security behind user mode and kernel mode is driven by what user mode has access to. All calls from user-mode are made through system calls which are interfaces to the kernel where properties can be passed through registers or as blocks. Further the memory addressing space is limited to that particular user-mode session, this allows the kernel to be trusted to work across the entire memory space for multi-user without giving that same access to the user sessions. In this way kernel mode acts as a filter or constraint preventing user-mode free reign of system resources.",
    "answerKey": "The distinction between kernel mode and user mode provides a rudimentary form of protection in the following manner. Certain instructions could be executed only when the CPU is in kernel mode. Similarly, hardware devices could be accessed only when the program is executing in kernel mode. Control over when interrupts could be enabled or disabled is also possible only when the CPU is in kernel mode. Consequently, the CPU has very limited capability when executing in user mode, thereby enforcing protectino of critical resources."

    "question":"<div>Some early computers protected the operating system by placing it in a memory partition that could not be modified by either the user job or the operating system itself. Describe two difficulties that you think could arise with such a scheme.</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>Due to the volatile nature of memory this can lead to errors and the performance impact due to constant switching of contexts, and finally the continued growth of the entire operating system has ballooned which could increase demand and cost for memory resources on computers.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>The data required by the operating system (passwords, access controls, accounting information, and so on) would have to be stored in or passed through unprotected memory and thus be accessible to unauthorized users.</div>"
  },{ 
    "number": "1.8",
    "question":"<div>Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation. What are two possible uses of these multiple modes?</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>These multiple modes provide different tiers of privoleged access. Perhaps a user does not require access to all system resources but require more than a general user, privileged mode can be carved into varying levels of sensitivity. Second for virtualization, this can offer an opportunity to provide an embedded tiering of modes inside of a virtual machine that will have it's own kernel mode without providing risk to breaking out of the VM and executing privileged operations.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>Although most systems only distinguish between user and kernel modes, some CPUs have supported multiple modes. Multiple modes could be used to provide a finer-grained security policy. For example, rather than distinguishing between just user and kernel mode, you could distinguish between different types of user mode. Perhaps user belonging to the same group could execute each other's code. The machine would go into a specified mode when one of these users was running code. When the machine was in this mode, a member of the group could run code belonging to anyone else in the group. Another possibility would be to provide different distinctions within kernel code. For example, a specific mode could allow USB device drivers to run. This would mean that USB devices could be serviced without having to switch to kernel mode, thereby essentially allowing USB device drivers to run in a quasi-user/kernel mode.</div>"

    "question":"<div>Timers could be used to compute the current time. Provide a short description of how this could be accomplished.</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>The timer is set to throw an interrupt at a fixed rate. So for example a timer set to interrupt once every 60 seconds meaning each interrupt is a minute. A counter can be incremented that is a calculation of initial time at startup added to elapsed time providing the current time calculation.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>A program could use the following approach to compute the current time using timer interrupts. The program could set a timer for some time in the future and go to sleep. When it is awakened by the interrupt it could update its local state, which it is using to keep track of the number of interrupts it has received thus far. It could then repeat this process of continually setting timer interrupts and updating its local state when the interrupts are actually raised.</div>"

    "question":"<div>Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve? What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk), why not make it that large and eliminate the device?</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>Two reasons why caches are valuable is it provides a faster level access to datum that may be stored on slower drives. The most frequently used data (or whichever chosen algorithm) can determine what data will be most likely accessed and have it prepared for for access. Additionally sometimes raw data is stored in a way that requires some algorithm/operation of compute to access this. This overhead can be paid once on first access and subsequent accesses can bypass this computational preparation cost. The problem this creates (and in general with caches is a greater challenge) is the invalidation strategy and timeliness of data. Determining when data is no longer valid or has gone stale and should no longer be re-used can be a challenging process. The more time-sensitive data or the more random nature of data access can create a level of eviction that defeats the performance and cost of caching (arguably creating the potential of adding more overhead and complexity) making this less desirable a solution. The reason that you may not make the cache as large as a disk is due to the volatile nature of faster access systems (RAM, Registers) and lack of persistence. This also adds a significant increase in cost when the 80% of data accessed can be easily covered by a smaller affordable cache.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div>Caches are useful when two or more components need to exchange data, and the components perform transfers at differing speeds. Caches solve the transfer problem by providing a buffer of intermediate speed between the components. If the fast device finds the data it needs in the cache, it need not wait for the slower device. the data in the cache must be kept consistent with the data in the components. If a component has a data value change, and the datum is also in the cache, the cache must also be updated. This is especially a problem on multiprocessor systems where more than one process may be accessing a datum. A component may be eliminated by an equal-sized cache, but only if: (a) the cache and the component have equivalent state-saving capacity (that is, if the component retains its data when electricity is removed, the cache must retain data as well), and (b) the cache is affordable, because faster storage tends to be more expensive.</div>"

    "question":"<div>Distinguish between the client-server and peer-to-peer models of distributed systems</div>",
    "answerIndividual": "<div>Client-Server architecture is configured so that you are provided the endpoint (or a registry) that you will communicate with directly. There is software (or a browser) that you leverage as the client typically to communicate with the backing server. In a peer-to-peer model each client also has the ability to act as a server. This means that there is a network of clients that you are aware of and can communicate directly with other clients that may or may not handle or forward your requests in a server like fashion.</div>",
    "answerKey": "<div><div>The client-server model firmly distinguishes the roles of the client and server. Under this model, the client requests services that are provided by the server. The peer-to-peer model doesn't have such strict roles. In fact, all nodes in the system are considered peers and thus may act as <i>either</i> clients or servers, or both. A node may request a service from another peer, or the node may in fact provide such a service to other peers in the system.</div><div>For example, let's consider a system of nodes that share cooking recipes. Under the client-server model, all recipes are stored with the server. If a client wishes to access a recipe, it must request the recipe from the specified server. Using the peer-to-peer model, a peer node could ask other peer nodes for the specified recipe. The node (or perhaps nodes) with the requested recipe could provide it to the requesting node. Notice how each peer may as both a client (it may request recipes) and as a server (it may provide recipes).</div></div>"
