    "answerKey": "<div>The three main purposes are:<ul><li>To provide an environment for a computer user to eecute programs on computer hardware in a convenient and efficient manner.</li><li>To allocate the separate resources of the computer as needed to solve the problem given. The allocation process should be as fair and efficient as possible.</li><li>As a control program it serves two major functions: (1)supervision of the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer, and (2) management of the operation and control of I/O devices.</li></ul></div>"

    "question":"<div>We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to <i>Waste</i> resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?</div>", 
    "answerIndividual": "<div>On single-user systems the system should be as efficient as possible maximizing resource utilization. When operating as a multi-user system, context switching and the overhead and dynamic nature of workloads being executed introduces potential lossses of efficiency for individual tasks in order to distribute resources in an apparent simultaneous manner to end-users. Resource utilization tends to be general purpose in nature and less specialized for a specific workload.</div>",
